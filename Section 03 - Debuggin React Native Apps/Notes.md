# Section 03 - Debugging React Native Apps (Introduction)

## Module Introduction

    - Debug React Native Applications.

## Handling Errors

    - The terminal helps us, there we can see the problem and what component(s), creates the component.
    - In the emulator, we can see errors too, clicking the message at the bottom.
    - In terminal the error is a bit better to understand but in the emulator not too much.

## Logging to the console

    - With console.log(), we can debug too, writing some messages inside components, functions, etc, to see if everything is going well or not.

## Debuggin JavaScript remotely

    - Expo Go has come with some option to trigger some stuffs.
    - If we type m, a developer menu will show up.
    - We can get a DevTool to debug the React code.

## Using the React DevTools

    - We should install react-devtools in the project or globally.
    - To install it: npm install react-devtools
    - To run it: react-devtools
        - All this with the application running.
    - We get devtools like the browser.

## Using the documentation
